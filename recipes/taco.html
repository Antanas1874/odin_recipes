    <p>
      This is a meatless taco in a corn tortilla. Simple and delicious. You will
      want seconds or thirds. Shhh.

    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, cut into 1/4-inch slices</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion;
        cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned golden brown,
        about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garlic and red pepper flakes, stirring until fragrant, about 1
        minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the chicken broth, Swiss chard, and salt. Cover and reduce heat
        to low.
      </li>
      <li>Simmer until chard is nearly tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Remove lid and increase heat to medium, stirring until the liquid
        evaporates, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
      </li>
